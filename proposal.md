Term Project Proposal

The Basics
--> Platformer game: you play as a particle/thing/blob coasting on a planet/land mass/structure that rotates in place. The structure grows procedurally complex and your goal is to stay on its surface, i.e. not get trapped inside it.

Precedents
--> Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy (Bennett Foddy) ----> for Sisyphean atmosphere
--> Art Sqool (Julian Glander) ----> for visual design, sfx

Version Control
--> for TP1, will likely work within a single main.py file and update it by pushing to this repo. Significant enough changes will result in a file name change, e.g.

main_0.py (starter)
main_1.py (basic classes defined)
main_2.py (physics applied)

Each commit/push will be sufficiently descriptive; i.e., at least summarize main changes made. Will create a separate questions.txt file of some sort to log any questions along the way.
