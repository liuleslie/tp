# Term Project Proposal

## The Basics
- Endless (?) runner/platformer game: you play as a particle/thing/blob coasting on a planet/land mass/structure that rotates in place. The structure grows procedurally complex and your goal is to stay on its surface, i.e. not get trapped inside it.
- Title TBD
- The procedural form generation of the structure/land mass/pseudoplanet draws from a shape grammar defined [in this schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuleslie/liuleslie.github.io/refs/heads/main/journal-media/ShapeGrammar_Schematic.png) and demonstrated in [this video](https://vimeo.com/1025495834).

## Precedents
- Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy (Bennett Foddy) — for Sisyphean atmosphere; there may be the potential to craft a narrative or explain the shape grammar in a stylized way
- Art Sqool (Julian Glander) — for visual design, sfx; player's movement could be punctuated by small audio feedback
- Hermit (Lingdong Huang) — for visual design and general approach; I really appreciated the meditative quality of Hermit and hope that my game might be something similarly calming, and perhaps reflective about asemic writing, or the nature of the relationship between writing/calligraphy and image/drawing.
- Future Flyer (Manaen Hu) — for how the game design aids worldbuilding.
- Othello 112 (Kat Studentsova) — for reference on how to characterize the procedural generation of terrain; whether to position it as a sentient or knowing entity, as if another player.

## Version Control

For TP1, will likely work within a single main.py file and update it by pushing to this repo. Significant enough changes will result in a file name change, e.g.
- main_0.py (starter)
- main_1.py (basic classes defined)
- main_2.py (physics applied)

Each commit/push will be sufficiently descriptive; i.e., at least summarize main changes made. Will create a separate questions.txt file of some sort to log any questions along the way.
